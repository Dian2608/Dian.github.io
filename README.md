# Portfolio
## Introduction
Welcome! 
This is my portfolio for the workflows lessons of the Data Science for biology 2 course. The portfolio consists of a number of assignments from the lessons and a free assignment. You can access the bookdown of my portfolio using this link: https://dian2608.github.io/
I also made my own R package. It can be found via this link: <br>

## AMR introduction <br>
In the AMR introduction folder an introduction has been written for the project I am working on with two fellow students. My group got the subject Antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The aim of this project is to map the distribution of AMR genes (which are present on bacterial plasmids) in the Netherlands. This using illumina paired-end sequencing data.

## C. elegans experiment <br>
The data of this experiment was kindly supplied by J. Louter (INT/ILC) and was derived from an experiment in which adult C.elegans nematodes were exposed to varying concentrations of different compounds. The variables RawData (the outcome - number of offspring counted as an integer value, after incubation time), compName (the generic name of the compound/chemical), the compConcentration (the concentration of the compound), and the expType are the most important variables in this dataset. <br>
The excel file with the data that was used for this analysis is stored in the Data_raw folder. <br>

## Curriculum vitae <br>
My CV is displayed in this folder. Personal data, such as address and telephone number, have been omitted.

## Guerrilla Analytics framework <br>
The Guerrilla Analytics framework (from this booklet: https://shop.elsevier.com/books/T/A/9780128002186) was used to create a folder tree. The folder tree is created for my DAUR2 folder from the course Data Science for biology 1. 

## MS data processing <br>
Raw mass spectrometry data has been analyzed to provide more knowledge about the analysis of mass spectrometry data using R.

## Parameterized report <br>
In this report the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths from 2020 till 2022 is analyzed. Parameters were used to visualize the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The csv file with the data that was used for this analysis is stored in the Data_raw folder.

## Relational databases <br>
Data about the flu and dengue fever occurrences between 2002 and 2015 was analyzed. This data is from Google Dengue Trends weekly dengue activity for the world and Google Flu Trends weekly influenza activity estimates for the world. <br>
The csv files with the data that was used for this analysis is stored in the Data_raw folder. The produced files of the analysis are shown in the Data folder. <br>

## Reproducibility of scientific publications <br>
Often times the used R code for rendering and inspecting data is not visualized in a publication. For this reason a article was scored on the basis of ‘Repita’ criteria. <br>
More information about these criteria can be found under the following link: <br>

The excel file with the data that was used for this analysis is stored in the Data_raw folder. <br>
